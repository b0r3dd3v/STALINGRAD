# Stalin∇

Stalin∇ is a brutally optimizing compiler for the VLAD language, a pure dialect of Scheme with first-class automatic differentiation operators.

## Authors

Written by [Jeffrey Mark Siskind](http://www.ece.purdue.edu/~qobi), with [Barak A. Pearlmutter](http://barak.pearlmutter.net) doing a little cheerleading.

## Building

Requires a Scheme compiler and the QobiScheme infrastructure.

## Installing

cp stalingrad /usr/local/bin/
